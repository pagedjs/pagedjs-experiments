We can’t really have mark sync because we’re breaking too much the algoryhtm

but we can fake it:

if a h2 is a sync, then we can actually add the class in the before parsed and divide the content  

section > h2 + h2 + h2

becomes 

section h2 + section h2 + section h2 ....

and then we add the class neededd to build the parallel flow using the class

would be the same as writing a better html: 

make your html to work as if you were in a grid: 

#section-1-fr, #section-1-en {
  --parallel-flow: alpha;
}

and then 

#section-2-fr, #section-2-en {
  --parallel-flow: beta;
}
